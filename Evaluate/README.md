compile:

    cgal_create_CMakeLists -s main
    cmake -DCGAL_DIR=/user/lib/CGAL -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
    make

run:
    $./main -i <point set path> -Î¿ <output file>

To compile and run the program you can use the exe.sh bash script:

    chmod x+u exe.sh    (only need this for the first time you compile-run)
    ./exe.sh            (for every other time you want to compile-run)


Input file should be in this form:

         || <Algorithm 1>                                 || <Algorithm 2>           || . . .
    Size || min score | max score | min bound | max bound || <same cols as previously>
    10   || <double> | <double> | <double> | <double>     || . . .
    20   || . . .

Program Description:

    Implemented a script to run two algorithm on any given file in a directory. Calculate the ratio between area produced by algorithms and convex hull area. The result is written into the desired output file.

Observations:

    While implemented the task, we came to the conclusion that the most consistand and fast algorithms to use are incremental-simulated annealing(local step) and convex hull-simulated annealing(global step). The second algorithm is much slower that the first one but produces better area results. Other algorithm compinations were slower or produced poor results (example convex hull-local search)

Code improvements:

    We improved the runtime of our code by:
        -Cutting unnecessary checks in convex hull algorithm.
        -Calculate the area of the polygon using triangles instead of using the polygon area
            function
        -Avoiding unnecessary checks in Simulated_Annealing(local Step)at the intersect
            function
        -Changing the visibility check in simulated_Annealing
        -Avoiding unnecessary checks in incremental algorithm by changing the visibility
            check.
