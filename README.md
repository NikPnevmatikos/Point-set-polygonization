# Point-set-polygonization
Given a set of 2D Points, create a simple Polygon with min or max area


 **[Point Set Polygonization](./Point-Set-Polygonization):** Implementation of two greedy algorithms(incremental or convex_hull) to find the min/max area approximately\
 **[Optimal Polygon](./Optimal-Polygon):** Implementantion of two algorithms(Local Search or Simulated Annealing) to improve the max/min area of a polygon found using 
  **[Point Set Polygonization](./Point-Set-Polygonization)**\
 **[Evaluate](./Evaluate):** Implementation of a script that runs two set of algorithms for all files with a set of 2d points in a given directory. Results are written in a new file.
